## Project summary

### The issue we are hoping to solve

Wildcats like (Tigers, Leopards, Jaguars,Lions,etc) are on the way to extinction in INDIA. A combination of habitat loss,poaching,prey scarcity is driving the overall population to a point where it's no longer viable.

Aim to get better conservation of wild cats by -
- Assisting patrol and protecting their habitats.
- Better surveillance of these soon-to-be endangered species.
- Reduce those factors which leads to depletion of wild cat numbers by proper management.
- Recitifying the habitat damage by providing alternatives.
- Promotion viable wild cat population per region/zone with effective re-location stratergies

### How our technology solution can help

Our solution will hopefully help
- map animal's routes
- track health
- relocation
- animal-human conflicts
- allow forest guards to enter sigthings, track changes, etc. 

### Our idea

We propose a solution to track information about wildcats' by tying together image recognition with location data. 
Since a forest is a vast area, scaling it manually is next to impossible. To help with this, we employ multi-level 
data gathering schemes -- Drones, Foot soldiers, static cams.

Foot soldiers are part of the wildlife/forest dept and can take images of wildcats whenever spotted. 
Static cams can be installed in places of high animal traffic -- where wildcats are most expected. This can be near water sources,
food sources etc.
Drones to cover remote areas which are out-of-reach from humans. With adequate sensing, the drones should be able to detect and snap
pictures of wildcats.


All these data gathered will be coupled with the location of the wildcat, to better track their areas of activity and monitor them 
for any abnormal issues. 

The data gathered will be processed, and fed to an ML model that will classify, and detect any deviation from usual routines. 
With this, the operators can not only track the wildcats better, but also prevent them from straying into busy urban areas. 
By providing better visibility into the lifestyle of wildcats, we can have a better chance at their conservation.

## Technology implementation

### IBM AI service(s) used

_INSTRUCTIONS: Included here is a list of commonly used IBM AI services. Remove any services you did not use, or add others from the linked catalog not already listed here. Leave only those included in your solution code. Provide details on where and how you used each IBM AI service to help judges review your implementation. Remove these instructions._

- [IBM Natural Language Understanding](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION
- [Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION
- [Watson Discovery](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-discovery) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION
- [Watson Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/speech-to-text) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION
- [Watson Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/text-to-speech) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION
- List any additional [IBM AI services](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?category=ai#services) used or remove this line

### Other IBM technology used

INSTRUCTIONS: List any other IBM technology used in your solution and describe how each component was used. If you can provide links to/details on exactly where these were used in your code, that would help the judges review your submission.

### Solution architecture

Diagram and step-by-step description of the flow of our solution:

![Video transcription/translaftion app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Presentation materials

_INSTRUCTIONS: The following deliverables should be officially posted to your My Team > Submissions section of the [Call for Code Global Challenge resources site](https://cfc-prod.skillsnetwork.site/), but you can also include them here for completeness. Replace the examples seen here with your own deliverable links._
